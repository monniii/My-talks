Here are some example commands you can run to trigger the audit rules you set up. Since you are not using a specific user ID in your rules, these commands are general and will work regardless of the user executing them.

---

### **1. Trigger the File Access Rule (`/etc/passwd`)**

#### View the file (read access):
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

#### Edit the file (write access):
```bash
sudo nano /etc/passwd
```

#### Append to the file (write access):
```bash
echo "# Test entry for auditctl demo" | sudo tee -a /etc/passwd
```

---

### **2. Trigger the Command Execution Rule (without user ID)**

Monitor command executions by adding this rule:
```bash
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k command_execution
```

Then run any command to trigger it. For example:
```bash
ls
pwd
whoami
```

Alternatively, you can run a shell script to generate multiple events:
```bash
echo -e "#!/bin/bash\necho Hello World\nls -l" > test_script.sh
chmod +x test_script.sh
./test_script.sh
```

---

### **3. Trigger the Directory Monitoring Rule (`/var/log`)**

#### Modify a file in the `/var/log` directory:
```bash
sudo echo "Test log entry" >> /var/log/test_log.log
```

#### Create a new file in `/var/log`:
```bash
sudo touch /var/log/new_test_file.log
```

#### Change file attributes in `/var/log`:
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /var/log/syslog
```

---

### **4. View Live Audit Logs**
To verify your activities are being logged, use:

#### View logs in real-time:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

#### Search for logs with a specific key:
If your rules have keys (e.g., `passwd_monitor`, `command_execution`, etc.), use:
```bash
sudo ausearch -k passwd_monitor
sudo ausearch -k command_execution
sudo ausearch -k log_directory
```

Using Fanotify

nano fanotify_demo.c

To compile: 
gcc fanotify_demo.c -o fanotify_demo

Verify if it's running or not:
sudo ./fanotify_demo

Make some events in /tmp
echo "Hello Bangalore" > /tmp/example1.txt
echo "Hello all" > /tmp/example1.txt
